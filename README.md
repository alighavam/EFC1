Project "Extension Flexion Chord" - DiedrichsenLab 2022

EFC1 contains the analysis codes for the first behavioral bit of the EFC project. Extension-Flexion finger configurations (chords) are produced by subjects. We are trying to explain the difficulty of the chords. Our hypthesis is that the difficulty of the chods can be explained alone by the likelihood of chords' muscle patterns being from the natural hand usage muscle patterns distribution cloud.
